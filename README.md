# Data-Cleaning
We cleaned the raw auto sales data by removing duplicates and missing values, standardizing text formats (names, cities, countries), converting data types for dates and numbers, extracting only the date from Order Date, formatting postal codes, and calculating total sales. This made the dataset accurate and ready for analysis.
